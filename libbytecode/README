libbytecode -- A Library for Generating Java Class Files
--------------------------------------------------------

This library provides a C API for creating and generating Java Class files.

This code was originally part of the f2j back-end code generator, but we
thought it could be useful in other projects, so we split it off into an
independent library.

To build:

# ./configure
# make
