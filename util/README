f2j util package
----------------

This directory contains the org.netlib.util package, which is a set of helper
routines that must be in your CLASSPATH whenever compiling or running any
f2j-generated Java code.

This includes a modified version of Jocelyn Paine's Formatter package.  See
the README in org/j_paine/formatter.
