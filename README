LAPACK is a library of Fortran 77 subroutines for solving
the most commonly occurring problems in numerical linear algebra.
It is public-domain software, and can be used freely.

LAPACK is available via netlib, anonymous ftp, world wide web, and a
tar tape from NAG.

The tar tape contains the Fortran source for LAPACK, the testing programs, and
the timing programs.

It also contains Fortran code for the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
(the Level 1, 2, and 3 BLAS) needed by LAPACK.
However this code is intended for use only if there is no other implementation
of the BLAS already available on your machine; the efficiency of LAPACK
depends very much on the efficiency of the BLAS.

The complete package, including test code and timing programs in four
different Fortran data types (real, complex, double precision, double
complex), contains some 735,000 lines of Fortran source and comments.
You will need approximately 33 Mbytes to read the complete tape.
We recommend that you run the testing and timing programs.
The total space requirements for the testing and timing for all four data
types, including the object files, is approximately 80 Mbytes.

A README file containing the information in this letter is located
in the LAPACK directory. Postscript and LaTeX versions of the Quick
Installation Guide are in the LAPACK/INSTALL directory, in the files
lawn81.tex, psfig.tex, lawn81.ps, and org2.ps.  Consult the Installation
Guide for further details on installing the package and on what is contained
in each subdirectory.  For complete information on the LAPACK Testing
and Timing Suites please consult LAPACK Working Note 41 "Installation
Guide for LAPACK".

It is highly recommended that you obtain a copy of the Second Edition of
the LAPACK Users' Guide published by SIAM.  This second edition will be
ready sometime in late 1994.  This Users' Guide gives a detailed
description of the philosophy behind LAPACK as well as an explanation of
its usage.  The LAPACK Users' Guide can be purchased from:
SIAM; 3600 University City Science Center; Philadelphia, PA 19104-2688;
215-382-9800, FAX 215-386-7999.  It will also be available from booksellers.
To order by email, send email to service@siam.org.

The C version of LAPACK is now available.  Refer to the index on netlib
for more information.  

echo "send index from clapack" | mail netlib@ornl.gov

The C++ version of LAPACK is now available.  Refer to the index on netlib
for more information.  

echo "send index from c++/lapack++" | mail netlib@ornl.gov

Or, for more information on the distributed-memory version of LAPACK,
consult the ScaLAPACK index on netlib:

echo "send index from scalapack" | mail netlib@ornl.gov

LAPACK has been thoroughly tested, on many different
types of computers.  The LAPACK project supports the package in the
sense that reports of errors or poor performance will gain immediate
attention from the developers. Such reports, descriptions 
of interesting applications, and other comments should be sent by
electronic mail to lapack@cs.utk.edu.

A list of known problems, bugs, and compiler errors for LAPACK is
maintained on netlib.  For a copy of this report, send email to
netlib@ornl.gov with a message of the form: send release_notes from lapack.

A number of technical reports were written during the development of
LAPACK and published as LAPACK Working Notes, initially by Argonne
National Laboratory and later by the University of Tennessee.  Many of 
these reports later appeared as journal articles.  Most of these working
notes are available in postscript form from netlib.  To receive a list of
available reports, send email to netlib@ornl.gov with a message of the
form: send index from lapack/lawns.
Otherwise, requests for copies of these working notes can be sent to
the following address.
