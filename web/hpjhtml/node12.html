NetSolve is still a relatively young, rapidly developing
project which is bound to greatly improve in the near future.  The
Java GUI and API to NetSolve will reflect these improvements when
appropriate, evolving to provide the user with attractive new features.
The most interesting improvements will most likely take place within
the Java GUI since the API should stay as simple as possible.  The GUI
on the other hand can integrate new modules on demand.  For instance,
it would be very feasible to add data visualization modules to the Java
GUI so that the user can be presented with the results of his or her
computations in an attractive graphical display.  Another possible
extension would be to develop some kind of MATLAB-like scripting
language with which the user could describe a whole numerical algorithm
using the NetSolve services. In fact, better than a scripting language,
would be a graphical interface describing a numerical algorithm as a
task-graph and where each node would be an invocation to a NetSolve
service. We have already started developing a prototype of such a
graphical interface in Java that could be integrated in the NetSolve
Java GUI. This prototype could eventually fit in an even broader
framework where the nodes of the graph are not limited to a NetSolve
service but perhaps describe a more general task, like a user's Java
program. Following this thread of ideas and new developments in the
Java world, it appears that users might want to call numerical software
<I>directly</I> from their applications or applets, instead of using
NetSolve. This might indeed be a good choice for users concerned with
security and who do not want their data to travel over the Internet, or
users whose applications do not require a large computational power,
or for users who have access to hardware computational resources and
plan to use some kind of native Java compiler, to ensure acceptable
performance levels. The following section describes a new project, just
started at the University of Tennessee, that will allow such users to
include calls to numerical libraries in their Java programs.
