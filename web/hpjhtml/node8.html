<P>
An important goal of the NetSolve
design is to provide several interfaces for a wide range of
target users. Presently, NetSolve provides
 C, Fortran, MATLAB and 
Java Application Programming interfaces (APIs). 
We also deemed that NetSolve needed a graphical interface
and this interface has been written in Java as well. The two Java
interfaces are described at the end of this section.
<P>
Another
concern is to keep  the interface as simple a possible. For example,
the
MATLAB interface contains only 2 functions&nbsp;:&nbsp;<TT>netsolve()</TT> and
<TT>netsolve_nb()</TT>. The first function allows the user to send
<I>blocking</I> requests to NetSolve whereas the second one
sends <I>non-blocking</I> requests.
In fact, every
interface provides non-blocking calls to NetSolve. When several
non-blocking
requests are sent to a NetSolve agent, they are dispatched between the
available computational resources according to the load balancing
schemes implemented by the agent. With minimal effort, the
NetSolve user can
achieve a degree of parallelism. Complete details regarding the various
interfaces as well as examples
can be found in&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#netsolveug">16</A>].
