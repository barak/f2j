<P>
As previously mentioned, the hosts in the NetSolve system can be
located anywhere on the Internet and can therefore be administered
by different institutions.  For this reason, NetSolve does not try
to impose any control on the different resources. This 
distributed computation approach is
very flexible, but it requires that NetSolve implement
fault tolerance mechanisms. Indeed, any resource can become
unreachable at any moment, perhaps because of a network failure,
a host failure, or simply 
because a system administrator reboots a host.
<P>
The NetSolve system ensures that a user request will be completed
unless every single resource has failed. When a client sends a request
to a NetSolve agent, it receives a sorted list of computational
servers to try. When one of these servers has been successfully
contacted,
the numerical computation is started. If the contacted server fails
during
the computation, then another server is contacted and the computation is
restarted. This whole process is transparent to the user. If all the
servers have failed, then the user is notified that the computation
can not be performed at that time. The server-list 
strategy represents a first step
towards fault tolerance and will be improved in future versions of the
software.
