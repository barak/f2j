<P>
As Java's popularity grows, it becomes more and more 
crucial to provide reliable ways to write Java programs
that perform scientific computation. There are basically two reasons
why Java is often claimed to be inappropriate for scientific computing.
The first reason is that Java is generally interpreted and is therefore 
unable to run at machine speed. The second reason is that no standard
numerical libraries have been translated yet to Java bytecode (or source for that
matter). The first reason seems to be less and less or a concern as
native compilers are being provided by software developers, so that Java can
be used as any other language to develop code on those platforms. Even the speed
of applets can be raised to new levels with JIT techniques. However, compiled
Java source on those platforms is of course not portable anymore as it is
not targeting the JVM any more.
<P>
Two projects underway at the University of Tennessee will provide
efficient, portable and reliable access to scientific computing facilities
using Java:&nbsp;NetSolve and f2j. Both projects achieve reliability
by providing access to standard numerical libraries. NetSolve possesses a framework
that allow easy integration of arbitrary numerical libraries
hosted on remote computational servers. f2j is for now
limited to libraries using a subset of Fortran 77. This subset is 
used by the BLAS and LAPACK libraries and is likely to be also 
sufficient for other standard numerical libraries or at least
easily expendable. Portability is also achieved by both NetSolve and f2j.
NetSolve's Java API of course leads to portable code since it 
is at the Java source level. f2j takes in input Fortran source and 
ultimately generates
portable Java class files. Two ways of generating this bytecode
are under investigation:&nbsp;either compiling Java source or assembling
JVM opcode. Going through Java source would be of course extremely interesting,
but as explained in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node13.html#sectionf2j">3</A>, it will require code
restructuring. Going through Java opcode is somewhat easier but is then
bound to a JVM execution. Finally, these two projects are also 
concerned with efficiency. NetSolve insures efficiency thanks to an agent-based 
design and computational servers that run optimized compiled Fortran numerical 
library functions. f2j depends on the efficiency of the 
run-time environment in which the generated class files are executed. 
Future work with f2j will minimize overhead by optimizing the 
emitted JVM opcode.
<P>
The NetSolve and f2j are emerging developmental projects
and are quite likely to undergo substantial modification 
and improvement as the involved research issues become better understood. 
Both projects aim at making Java-based scientific computing not only feasible
but attractive for a broad class of applications and users.
