<P>
Scientific computing has been a major part of
both research centers and industry for many years.
As such, it has been the object of many
investigations which have led to the development
of numerous software products. These products can be classified
into different categories. Some numerical
tools, like MATLAB&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#matlab">1</A>] or Mathematica&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#mathematica">2</A>],
have enjoyed great success. These tools generally provide
an interactive interface as well as the possibility of
writing scripts to perform computation.
<P>
Another class of products
falls under the category of numerical libraries.
Numerical libraries are less convenient
than interactive tools,
since the user generally is required to write a C
or Fortran program.
Nevertheless, they offer the advantages of execution speed and flexibility.
A very large number of such libraries exists and they cover
diverse fields of computational science.
Moreover, unlike interactive tools,
numerical libraries are often 
freely available (e.g., LAPACK).
<P>
A third class of tools
comprises runtime packages whose goal is to help the user perform
some specific type of built-in, scientific computation.
Like numerical libraries, such packages are usually freely available.
One example is
NEOS&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#neos">3</A>],
which is focused on linear programming and optimization.
<P>
Users wanting to solve a numerical problem are thus
confronted with a dilemma.
They can purchase a commercial product and take the risk that it might
not be
suitable for future use on different kinds of problems,
or they can try to locate and download free libraries and write programs
in terms of specific functions or subroutines.
NetSolve addresses this second situation, where
the user is confronted with many difficulties.
<P>
The first task the user must undertake is to look for the appropriate
library or set of libraries he or she needs for their own computational
problem. Usually, such libraries can be found in
software repositories. One well-known repository, for example,
is Netlib&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#netlib">4</A>], which is maintained through
the collaborative effort of several institutions and universities.
Software repositories present some intrinsic difficulties
for the inexperienced user:&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;they are generally
very large and (ii)&nbsp;contain very different types of libraries.
Once located, the appropriate library must be downloaded
and installed. Depending on the nature of the software,
this step might be nontrivial, especially for a user
having no experience with this kind of task. 
However, the biggest step still remains;
learning how to use the library itself,
that is, how to write a program in terms of its library components. 
Such a task can
be formidable and time-consuming
(even without regard for the debugging phase). Moreover, the user may want
to write the  program or script in a language 
that is different from the language
the numerical library has been written in. 
Even inter-language interoperability is possible,
the user must learn the techniques that are often
non-portable and require experience.
<P>
These considerations motivated the establishment of the NetSolve
project.
NetSolve is a client-server application
designed to solve computational science problems over a network.
A number of different
interfaces have been developed for the NetSolve software
so that users of C, Fortran, MATLAB, Java
or the Web can easily use the NetSolve system.
The underlying computational software can be any scientific package,
thereby ensuring good performance results.
Moreover, NetSolve uses a load-balancing strategy to
improve the use of the computational
resources available. The following section gives an overview
of the NetSolve system.
