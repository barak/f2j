<P>
For NetSolve to be accepted by many users, it must provide
several distinct ways to access computational resources,
mainly different user interfaces. Before the development of the
Java graphical interface, the only interfaces that were available were
MATLAB, C, and Fortran, leaving the MATLAB interface as the only
high-level and
interactive way of calling NetSolve. However, MATLAB is not freely
distributed and many users may not have it installed
on their workstations. We needed a freely available interactive
interface so that users not familiar with scientific computing could
still use NetSolve for their first steps in the field.
Furthermore, Java allowed us to effortlessly design a graphical
interface making
NetSolve even more straightforward for first-time users, even though an
experienced user is more likely to use the Fortran or MATLAB interface
if available.
<P>
NetSolve's interactive Java interface is entirely graphical. A window
displaying available computational methods is presented to the user,
who can point and click to solve the numerical problem of interest. The
user then supplies input by way of files, URLs, or interactively using
the keyboard.  Computation is handled as usual by a computational
server chosen by the NetSolve agent and the result is returned to the
user.  The results can be viewed and saved if necessary.
<P>
NetSolve's graphical  interface is multi-threaded, using Java's
built-in thread facilities.  Each computation is assigned to a separate
thread. Every request sent by the Java interface to the NetSolve
computational resource is represented by an independent window. By
opening several windows concurrently, the user can send multiple
requests simultaneously. Each  request will be handled by different
computational servers, thanks to the agent's load balancing strategy.
This is very similar to the non-blocking calls to NetSolve from C,
Fortran, MATLAB or Java programs.
<P>
The pool of NetSolve resources can be a heterogeneous set of hosts,
i.e., two hosts can have different internal data representations. To
support heterogeneous environments, the agents, servers, and C, Fortran
and MATLAB interfaces use the XDR protocol&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#xdr">17</A>].  As part of
NetSolve, we developed a simple Java XDR-encoder, enabling our
interface to communicate with any server on any platform.  The Java
interface may then contact servers which expect XDR-encoded data.
<P>
One of the features of Java is that the Java virtual machine can enforce
a strict security scheme. Typically, the virtual machine embedded in a
Web-browser does not allow local file access, network connection except to the
Web server that served the applet. Presently, the Java interface to NetSolve
cannot be used as an applet within a Web browser because of these
security restrictions. Indeed, our interface is supposed to contact
many different servers scattered on the Internet and therefore perform
multiple network connections. It is possible to work around 
applet security restrictions
by setting up an appropriate daemon on the Web servers, but this would
not be a viable solution
in the long term, considering the mass of data that would transit
through the Web server.
However, the interface is fully functional as an application, running on
a system
which has a Java virtual machine, or distributed with  a Java 
Runtime Environment. Considering the increased interest in
Java,
most systems already have an implementation of the Java Development Kit
(JDK)
that includes the Java virtual machine and the javac compiler.
Our interface
should therefore be usable on virtually any platform
and future versions of Web-browsers allowing security levels to
be set by the user 
are likely to make the applet approach feasible.
