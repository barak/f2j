<P>
The primary role of the agent in the NetSolve system is to perform
load balancing among the different computational resources.
NetSolve is inherently a multi-request system. Several users can 
share computational resources by contacting the same agent or different
agents managing the same pool of resources.
In fact, even a single user can send multiple asynchronous
requests at once, as explained in the description of the
user interfaces. 
For each server, the agent uses
information contained in the user request (e.g., type of computation,
size of the problem), static information about
the server (speed of the host, numerical server available, etc.), and
<B>predictions</B> about the workload of the server's host and the
distance to the server's host over the network. These different pieces
of information are then combined to obtain an estimate of the time
required to process the user request on each computational server
(including network time and CPU time). For each clien't 
incoming request,
the NetSolve agent sorts the appropriate computational servers
by the estimated times, and is then able to process
the request accordingly. More details on the way the agent
performs this load balancing can be found in&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#netsolve">15</A>].
