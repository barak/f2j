<P>
The first graphical interface to NetSolve was written in
TK/TCL&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#tktcl">18</A>].  When Java became available, we decided that it
would be a much better choice to write a graphical interface for the
reasons described in the preceding section. By the time the first
version of the Java GUI was completed, Java had evolved to be accepted
as an important language by itself, not just a tool for running
programs (applets) within Web-browsers. The need for a Java API to
NetSolve then seemed clear, since NetSolve already provided C, Fortran
and MATLAB interfaces.  Fortunately, most of the internals of the GUI
could be re-used to implement a Java API. In fact, due to the
unexpected success of Java during the development of NetSolve, we were
lead to do some reverse engineering:&nbsp;extracting the internals of an
existing software for distribution as a stand-alone class library.
The API is still under development and has motivated some code
restructuring within the GUI.  It will match the other APIs to NetSolve
as closely as possible.
<P>
There are however some difficulties that are inherent to Java.  For
instance, Java does not support calling sequences to a same function
with a variable number of arguments.  Also, as explained in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node13.html#sectionf2j">3</A>, Java passes primitive types by value which
does not allow a calling sequence entirely compatible with the
underlying Fortran numerical libraries in the NetSolve computational
servers.  These difficulties are, however, surmountable, and an
attractive API will be presented for providing users with an ability to
write portable scientific computation applications and applets.  The
user developed  programs will be reliable because the NetSolve
computational servers use established and widely accepted numerical
libraries. They will also be efficient because of NetSolve's
agent-based design, allowing the user to achieve parallelism with
virtually no additional programming effort.
