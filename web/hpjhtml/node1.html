The Java language has 
become very successful since its formal introduction in 1995. 
The language itself
is very attractive:&nbsp;it is object oriented and standard class libraries provide very natural
interfaces to features
such as multi-threading, Internet communication and protocols, 
graphical components, Graphical User Interface (GUI) design facilities, 
customizable security restrictions, etc. 
More than the
language itself, 
Java's popularity may be attributed in part by its ability to be
executed as <I>applets</I> running within Web browsers.
Java source code is compiled into hardware independent <I>bytecode,</I> which
is then interpreted by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). A JVM can be
embedded in a Web Browser and,
with the appropriate security restrictions, 
execute bytecode programs called class files that are
 accessible from the World Wide Web.  JVMs are
being provided by an increasing number of software developers, 
sometimes as a standard
feature of their operating systems. 
It is possible to run Java <I>applications</I>
on these architectures as executable programs. 
To increase the performance of Java, just-in-time (JIT) and
native code compilers have also been developed.  JIT compilers
translate Java byte code to native code at run time.  Native
code compilers produce machine specific executables from 
Java source code.  The increase in execution speed is balanced
in each case by a corresponding decrease in 
platform independence.
<P>
Faced with the increasing acceptance of Java as a 
viable programming language  and the fact that it can be
used for multi-threaded Internet-based distributed applications, it is natural
to consider using Java for scientific computing. Scientific computing 
applications are generally written using pre-existing libraries that
address different fields of computational science (linear algebra, 
optimization, curve fitting, etc.).
It would, of course, be possible to 
hand-write directly, in Java, 
the numerical class libraries needed by Java programmers, but, 
considering the number of numerical libraries
available, the number of functions in each of these libraries and the number of
years that were invested in their development, rewriting and testing
all this software in Java would be a formidable task.
<P>
Several solutions 
can be found to avoid such a rewrite while still providing Java programs with
access to the numerical algorithms already implemented in Fortran.
Two projects currently being developed at the University of Tennessee.
One approach is to allow Java applications or applets to access computational
servers that can directly use pre-installed Fortran libraries. 
Such a scheme is enabled by
the NetSolve project which is the object of section <A HREF="node2.html#sectionnetsolve">2</A>.
As detailed in that section, NetSolve provides in fact much more than just this
computational server paradigm, and Java is only 
one of the ways to access the
NetSolve resources.
The other approach is to translate the Fortran source code
of the libraries of interest into Java class files. The f2j project 
is a first attempt at such translation and is 
described in section <A HREF="node13.html#sectionf2j">3</A>.
