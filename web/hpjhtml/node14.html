<BLOCKQUOTE> <EM>Real programmers program in Fortran,
and can do so in any language.

Following the development of NetSolve, the f2j project, 
recently started at the University of Tennessee, will provide
APIs for direct access to numerical libraries from Java programs.
f2j is a formal compiler that translates programs written using
a subset of Fortran 77 into a form that may be compiled
or assembled into Java class files. 
The first priority for f2j is to translate the 
BLAS&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#blas1">11</A>, <A HREF="node18.html#blas2">12</A>, <A HREF="node18.html#blas3">13</A>] and LAPACK&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#lapack">10</A>] 
numerical libraries from their Fortran 77 source code to Java 
class files. 
The subset of Fortran 77 translated by f2j matches the
Fortran source used by 
BLAS and LAPACK. These libraries are established, reliable
and widely accepted linear algebra packages,
and are therefore a reasonable first testbed for our translator.
Many other libraries of interest are expected to use 
a very similar subset of Fortran 77.
<P>
The primary motivation for this project is to provide 
the reliability and dependability of the LAPACK
numerical linear algebra subroutines as class files available
for use in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Targeting the JVM provides access
to legacy code for distributed computation via the 
World Wide Web.  Similar previous efforts such as 
f2c&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#feldmansi95">20</A>], have proven to be 
very popular and widely used. 
The BLAS and LAPACK class files 
will be provided as a service of the Netlib
repository.  f2j also provides a base for 
a more ambitious effort translating a larger
subset of Fortran, and perhaps eventually <I>any</I> Fortran
source into Java class files.
<P>
Popular opinion seems to hold the somewhat erroneous
view that Java is ``too slow'' for numerical
programming.  However, there are presently
many small to intermediate scale problems where 
speed is not an issue.
For instance, physical quantities such as permeability,
stress and strain are commonly represented by 
ellipsoids&nbsp;[<A HREF="node18.html#malvernle69">21</A>, <A HREF="node18.html#longjcs82">22</A>], a
graphical representation of an underlying tensor.  
The tensor is mathematically represented by an SPD
matrix.  Ellipsoid axes are computed from the root
inverse of the tensor's eigenvalues, directed along
the tensor's eigenvectors. A LAPACK eigenproblem 
subroutine such as SSYTRD, available as 
a Java class file, provides 
a portable solution with known reliability.
Since future execution speeds of Java will increase
as just-in-time (JIT) and native code compilers 
are developed, the scale of feasible numerical programming
will increase as well.
