<p>Currently, just a <a href="f2jsrc.tar.gz">tarball 
of source</a> capable of correctly 
translating LAPACK 2 is available.  Future plans 
include adding documentation of the source,
documentation on how to use the source to 
translate, and perhaps a pointer on how to 
jlapack.</p>


<p>Comments welcome.</p>
