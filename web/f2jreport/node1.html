<BLOCKQUOTE> <EM>Real programmers program in F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>,
and can do so in any language.

<P>
Popular opinion seems to hold the somewhat erroneous
view that Java is ``too slow'' for numerical
programming.  However, the Java Linpack benchmark
[<A HREF="node35.html#linpackjava">2</A>]
has recorded excellent floating point arithmetic 
speeds (68.6 Mflop) on a PC
resulting from Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation 
of Java class files.  Also, there are 
many small to intermediate scale problems where 
speed is not an issue.
For instance, physical quantities such as permeability,
stress and strain are commonly represented by 
ellipsoids&nbsp;[<A HREF="node35.html#malvernle69">3</A>, <A HREF="node35.html#longjcs82">4</A>], a
graphical representation of an underlying tensor.  
The tensor is mathematically represented by an SPD
matrix.  Ellipsoid axes are computed from the root
inverse of the matrix eigenvalues, directed along
the eigenvectors. A LAPACK eigenproblem 
subroutine such as SSYTRD, available as 
a Java class file, provides 
a portable solution with known reliability.
Since future execution speeds of Java will increase
as JIT and native code compilers 
are developed, the scale of feasible numerical programming
will increase as well.
<P>
The JLAPACK project provides Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs) to numerical libraries from Java programs.
The numerical libraries will be distributed as class files
produced by a F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>-to-Java translator, f2j. The
f2j translator is a formal compiler that translates programs written using
a subset of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>  77 into a form that may be compiled
or assembled into Java class files. 
The first priority for f2j is to translate the 
BLAS&nbsp;[<A HREF="node35.html#blas1">5</A>, <A HREF="node35.html#blas2">6</A>, <A HREF="node35.html#blas3">7</A>] and LAPACK&nbsp;[<A HREF="node35.html#lapack">8</A>] 
numerical libraries from their F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>  77 reference source code to Java 
class files. 
The subset of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>  77 translated by f2j matches the
Fortran source used by 
BLAS and LAPACK. These libraries are established, reliable
and widely used linear algebra packages,
and are therefore a reasonable first testbed for f2j.
Many other libraries of interest are expected to use 
a very similar subset of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>  77.
<P>
A similar previous translation effort provided LAPACK in the 
C language, using the f2c program&nbsp;[<A HREF="node35.html#feldmansi95">9</A>], 
and has proven to be 
very popular and widely used. 
The BLAS and LAPACK class files 
will be provided as a service of the Netlib
repository.  f2j also provides a base for 
a more ambitious effort translating a larger
subset of Fortran, and perhaps eventually <I>any</I> Fortran
source into Java class files.
<P>
The JLAPACK project is composed of three phases:
<OL><LI> Phase 1: Writing a F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font> compiler front end to tokenize
(lexically analyze), parse  and construct an abstract
syntax tree (AST) for F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font> 77 input files.<LI> Phase 2: Generating Java source and Jasmin opcode for
use with the JVM from the AST.<LI> Phase 3: Testing, documenting and distributing BLAS and LAPACK 
class files.
</OL>
All phases are now complete with respect to the initial design criteria 
(for Java source).  Significant progress has been made in the
translation to Jasmin opcode, which is roughly 50% complete.
The Phase 3 testing for BLAS and LAPACK resulted in some changes 
to the initial code design,
requiring the Fortran front-end to be significantly extended.
