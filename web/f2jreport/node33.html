<P>
F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font> still excels for numerical
programming, and is not likely to be challenged anytime in the 
foreseeable future.  Indeed, more powerful versions of the 
F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font> language (HPF, F90)
have been developed.  The numerical libraries 
originally developed in F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>, such as BLAS and LAPACK,
are <EM>de facto</EM> reference implementations of 
specific numerical algorithms.
<P>
Translating F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font> directly to Java
probably won't provide optimal execution speeds.  However,
it is a convenient first step.  
The issue addressed with JLAPACK
is not whether it is possible to derive algorithms
implemented in Java that provide the same efficiency as
existing algorithms written in F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>.  This hasn't been
resolved.  
In some cases, a different
algorithm, derived to take advantage of
Java's strengths, may provide near F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font> speeds when used
with a JIT or compiled to native code.
The issue is ``how do we express, in Java, 
algorithms that are well known and understood, reliable,
efficient and thoroughly debugged, currently written in 
F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font>.'' The f2j compiler is a first step in this direction.
<P>
Since these algorithms are applicable for a broad
range of problems over a broad range of scales, providing
reliable implementations in other languages such as 
C and Java provides a
great benefit to the numerical computing user community.
While numerical analysts may find F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font> the most 
efficient language for algorithm development, engineers and scientists
in other disciplines may need to use a different language,
such as Java, for application development.  
The numerical algorithm, instead of being the point of the 
program, is a tool useful for accomplishing
its specified task.
<P>
The f2j compiler provides an excellent base upon which to 
build a more general compiler that translates a larger subset 
of F<font size=-1><small>ORTRAN</small></font> into Java.  For performance reasons, it may 
still be necessary to have some user control over how 
variables are passed and arrays accessed, but there are no
formal obstacles, other than fully implementing the EQUIVALENCE
statement.  Such a tool could also perform code restructuring
using the information implicit in the abstract syntax
tree constructed during parsing. 
The popularity of the <I>f2c</I> translator
indicates that <I>f2j</I> will be a popular and useful tool.
