Although all three Phases of the f2j compiler are complete,
there are still some aspects of the system that should be
done or would help by being done.
The following list details some of these.
<P>
<OL><LI>  f2j currently only handles one file 
at a time.  Allowing multiple files could 
probably be implemented rather easily, but each 
should be freed before parsing in new files.<LI> The front-end parser and lexer are adequate
for the BLAS and LAPACK libraries, but they really
should be updated in order for f2j to be useful for
a wide variety of libraries.<LI>  Need compiler to &quot;automatically&quot; figure how 
which package the routine should go into, and which
files to import.  This can be hacked by using
the preprocessor, or by command line switches, etc.
Also, may help to switch over to Solaris for development.
That way some simple java tools can be used to control
compiling, etc.<LI> Write an error handling routine for yyparse to
indicate the approximate location of parse errors in
the input file.  Lex &amp; yacc book has example.
Note that the hook for this is in the lexer; line are 
counted.<LI>  Fix the in-line RELOP action in a similar way to 
 Name &lt;=&gt; NAME, etc.  In fact, 
all in-line actions should be removed from the
grammar file.<LI> Add code to the 'prelex()' routine to check 
whether there is six spaces of white at the beginning
of each non-continued statement.<LI> Testing toolset: suite of tools to test the lexer,
parser and functionality of translated source code.
So far I have two csh scripts: <TT>blascheck</TT> and
<TT>lapackcheck</TT> written to see how well src in the 
blas and lapack directories lex and parse.<LI> Fix the IF-ELSE shift/reduce error in the parser.<LI>  The JVM uses a stack, for which the number 
of local variables and the stack depth must be calculated in 
advance. There needs to be an algorithm derived for this,
keeping the track of the following data:
   <UL><LI> Number of locals has be at least the same as the number of 
   arguments, more if doubles are used, even more if 
   with typed variables.<LI>  The size of the stack can be calculated by keeping a 
running total of operations that affect the stack.
   </UL></OL><HR><A NAME="tex2html510" HREF="node43.html"><IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="next" SRC="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~icl/WebSite/icons/next_motif.gif"></A> <A NAME="tex2html508" HREF="f2jreport.html"><IMG WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="up" SRC="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~icl/WebSite/icons/up_motif.gif"></A> <A NAME="tex2html502" HREF="node41.html"><IMG WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="previous" SRC="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~icl/WebSite/icons/previous_motif.gif"></A>   <BR>
