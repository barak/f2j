Following is the description from the original
Fortran source.  For each array argument, the Java
version will include an integer offset parameter, so
the arguments may not match the description exactly.

 *
 *  Purpose
 *  =======
 *
 *  DSYTRF computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A using
 *  the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method.  The form of the
 *  factorization is
 *
 *     A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T
 *
 *  where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
 *  triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
 *  1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.
 *
 *  This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
 *
 *  Arguments
 *  =========
 *
 *  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
 *          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
 *          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
 *
 *  N       (input) INTEGER
 *          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
 *
 *  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
 *          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
 *          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
 *          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
 *          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
 *          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
 *          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
 *          triangular part of A is not referenced.
 *
 *          On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
 *          to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).
 *
 *  LDA     (input) INTEGER
 *          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
 *
 *  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
 *          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
 *          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
 *          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
 *          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
 *          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
 *          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
 *          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
 *          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
 *
 *  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LWORK)
 *          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
 *
 *  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
 *          The length of WORK.  LWORK >=1.  For best performance
 *          LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is the block size returned by ILAENV.
 *
 *  INFO    (output) INTEGER
 *          = 0:  successful exit
 *          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
 *          > 0:  if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
 *                has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
 *                exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
 *                is used to solve a system of equations.
 *
 *  Further Details
 *  ===============
 *
 *  If UPLO = 'U', then A = U*D*U', where
 *     U = P(n)*U(n)* ... *P(k)U(k)* ...,
 *  i.e., U is a product of terms P(k)*U(k), where k decreases from n to
 *  1 in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
 *  and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
 *  defined by IPIV(k), and U(k) is a unit upper triangular matrix, such
 *  that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then
 *
 *             (   I    v    0   )   k-s
 *     U(k) =  (   0    I    0   )   s
 *             (   0    0    I   )   n-k
 *                k-s   s   n-k
 *
 *  If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-1,k).
 *  If s = 2, the upper triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k-1,k-1), A(k-1,k),
 *  and A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-2,k-1:k).
 *
 *  If UPLO = 'L', then A = L*D*L', where
 *     L = P(1)*L(1)* ... *P(k)*L(k)* ...,
 *  i.e., L is a product of terms P(k)*L(k), where k increases from 1 to
 *  n in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
 *  and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
 *  defined by IPIV(k), and L(k) is a unit lower triangular matrix, such
 *  that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then
 *
 *             (   I    0     0   )  k-1
 *     L(k) =  (   0    I     0   )  s
 *             (   0    v     I   )  n-k-s+1
 *                k-1   s  n-k-s+1
 *
 *  If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(k+1:n,k).
 *  If s = 2, the lower triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k,k), A(k+1,k),
 *  and A(k+1,k+1), and v overwrites A(k+2:n,k:k+1).
