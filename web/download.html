The first beta release of the Java LAPACK is now available.  This is an
automatic translation from the original LAPACK 2.0 source code (Fortran 77)
to Java.  The current distribution
consists of class files organized in the following packages:
<ul>
<li> org.netlib.blas - the BLAS routines</li>
<li> org.netlib.lapack - the double precision LAPACK routines</li>
<li> org.netlib.util - utility routines and object wrappers</li>
</ul>
The source code is also included, but until the bytecode transformer is
released, it cannot be recompiled into working bytecode (read 
<a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/f2j/f2jreport/node11.html">this section</a>
of the tech report to understand why).

<p> Please read the <a href="jitnote.html">JIT Warning</a> before
downloading.
<hr>
Download JLAPACK 0.3a beta as a gzipped tar file: <A HREF="jlapack-0.3a.tgz">jlapack-0.3a.tgz</a>
<p> OR <p>
We now have the JLAPACK 0.3a beta available as a ZIP file: 
<A HREF="jla03a.zip">jla03a.zip</a>
<p>
To decompress the ZIP file, use your favorite unzip utility.
You may need to specify that directories should be created
rather than having everything unzipped into the current directory.
<p>
To decompress the .tgz file:
<p>
<code>gunzip jlapack-0.3a.tgz </code>
<p>
<code>tar xvf jlapack-0.3a.tar </code>
<p>
Or simply:<p><code>gunzip -c jlapack-0.3a.tgz | tar xvf - </code> <p>if
you're into that sort of thing. <p>

After downloading and uncompressing, follow the directions in the 
<a href="INSTALL">INSTALL</a> file.  Note especially the
warnings against recompilation.  Due to the postprocessing that we
must perform on the class files to support GOTO statements, the
code won't work when you recompile it unless you obtain the bytecode
translator.  Drop us a note if you really need to be able to
recompile the code.  The bytecode translator has currently been
tested only under Solaris.

<p>
If you would like to look at the Fortran source that was the
basis for this translation, you may download
<a href="jlapack.f.gz">jlapack.f.gz</a>.

<p>
For those who would like a local copy of the javadoc-generated documentation
for JLAPACK, we have it available in ZIP and tarred gzip formats:
 
<p>
<a href="jlapack_docs.zip">ljapack_docs.zip</a>
<p>
<a href="jlapack_docs.tgz">ljapack_docs.tgz</a>
<p>
Note: since there is a simplified version of each JLAPACK function that
differs only in case (one is all uppercase) from the regular version,
these archives do not extract correctly on Windows machines.  We may
try to restructure things if there are a lot of Windows users out there
who need a local copy of the documentation.
<p>

The BLAS/LAPACK testing routines are now available for download.
The same recompilation warnings apply here, too.  Download 
<a href="testers.tgz">testers.tgz</a> or <a href="testers.zip">testers.zip</a>.
As we test different on different machines and VMs,
we will post a summary of the results.  So far, the tests pass
on: <p>
Solaris/x86 2.5.1 with JDK1.2 (early access) and JIT disabled<p>
Solaris 2.5 with JDK1.1.6 <p>
Linux 2.0.29 with JDK1.1.3 <p>
Linux 2.0.29 with Kaffe0.10.0 <p>
Windows NT 4.0 with JDK1.1.6 and JIT disabled<p>
AIX 4.1.5 with JDK1.1.4 and JIT disabled<p>
FreeBSD 2.2.6 with JDK1.1.5 (thanks to Pedro Vazquez)<p>
Linux 2.2.5 (RedHat 6.0) with Blackdown's "pre-release" JDK 1.2 and JIT enabled (thanks to eric@cs.washington.edu) <p>


<br>
And we have seen failures on: <p>
<br>
Solaris/x86 2.5.1 with JDK1.2 and JIT (only 3 test case failures)<p>
Solaris 2.5 with Kaffe0.10.0<p>
Windows NT 4.0 with JDK1.1.6 and Symantec JIT<p>
AIX 4.1.5 with JDK1.1.4 and "jitc" JIT<p>
