The 0.5 release of the Java LAPACK is now available.  This is an
automatic translation from the original LAPACK 3.0 source code (Fortran 77)
to Java.  The current distribution
consists of class files organized in the following packages:
<ul>
<li> org.netlib.blas - the BLAS routines</li>
<li> org.netlib.lapack - the double precision LAPACK routines</li>
<li> org.netlib.err - error reporting routine for LAPACK</li>
<li> org.netlib.util - utility routines and object wrappers</li>
</ul>
The source code is also available, but the bytecode transformer is
required to recompile it into working bytecode (read 
<a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/f2j/f2jreport/node11.html">this section</a>
of the tech report to understand why).

<hr>
Download JLAPACK 0.5 as a gzipped tar file: <A HREF="jlapack-0_5.tgz">jlapack-0_5.tgz</a>
<p> OR <p>
We now have the JLAPACK 0.5 available as a ZIP file: 
<A HREF="jlapack-0_5.zip">jlapack-0_5.zip</a>
<p>
To decompress the ZIP file, use your favorite unzip utility.
You may need to specify that directories should be created
rather than having everything unzipped into the current directory.
<p>
To decompress the .tgz file:
<p>
<code>gunzip jlapack-0_5.tgz </code>
<p>
<code>tar xvf jlapack-0_5.tar </code>
<p>
Or simply:<p><code>gunzip -c jlapack-0_5.tgz | tar xvf - </code> <p>if
you're into that sort of thing. <p>

After downloading and uncompressing, follow the directions in the 
<a href="INSTALL">INSTALL</a> file.  Note especially the
warnings against recompilation.  Due to the postprocessing that we
must perform on the class files to support GOTO statements, the
code won't work when you recompile it unless you use the bytecode
translator.  The bytecode translator is part of the f2j source release
and has currently been tested only under Solaris and Linux.

<p>
For those who would like a local copy of the javadoc-generated documentation
for JLAPACK, we have it available in ZIP and tarred gzip formats:
 
<p>
<a href="jlapack-doc.zip">jlapack-doc.zip</a>
<p>
<a href="jlapack-doc.tgz">jlapack-doc.tgz</a>
<p>

<hr>
The BLAS/LAPACK testing routines are now available for download.
The same recompilation warnings apply here, too.  Download 
<a href="testers.tgz">testers.tgz</a> or <a href="testers.zip">testers.zip</a>.
As we test different on different machines and VMs,
we will post a summary of the results.  So far, the tests pass
on: <p>
Solaris 7 (sparc), Sun jdk 1.3.1, Hotspot <p>
Solaris 7 (sparc), Sun jdk 1.2.2 <p>
Redhat 7.1 (x86), Sun jdk 1.3.1, Hotspot <p>
Win2000 (x86), Sun jdk 1.2.2, classic vm, symcjit <p>
