The Fortran 2 Java (f2j) compiler project</H2>
</CENTER>

<p><img src="images/new_tiny.gif">
f2j <a href="f2jsrc">source</a> now available for your 
translating pleasure!  More information is available
on request, including LAPACK test suite, etc.  Enjoy.
More code and documentation will be posted intermittently.</p>

<p>BLAS and LAPACK package
<A HREF="docs/html/packages.html">documentation</A> now updated
with descriptions from the original Fortran source.</p>

<p> The JLAPACK code is now
available for <A HREF="download.html">download</a> in ZIP and gzip
formats.  The JLAPACK testers are also now available on the download page.
</p>

<p>Our primary motivation is to provide numerical linear algebra software
originally written in Fortran as Java class files. The first priority is
translating the Basic Linear Algeba Subroutines (BLAS) and the Linear Algebra
Package (LAPACK), a collection of driver subroutines built on the BLAS.
BLAS and LAPACK class files will be freely available, distributed by the
<A HREF="http://www.netlib.org">Netlib</A> numerical software repository.
The f2j project has two facets. One is to emit as much compilable, verifiable,
correctly running Java source from Fortran source code, the other is to
translate Fortran to Jasmin assembler opcode for assembly into class files.</p>

<P>Since ANSI Fortran 77 does not specify <TT>while</TT> loops, all such
constructions in the BLAS and LAPACK are implemented with goto statements.
The Java Assembler Interface (<A HREF="http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/meyer/jvm/">Jasmin</A>)
is capable of assembling files written in Sun's JVM opcode. Since the JVM
has built-in goto branching, Jasmin easily implements all goto statements
in the Fortran source. Since we now have a scheme to translate Fortran
<TT>GOTO </TT>statements into Java source code, we have not put much emphasis
on the Jasmin code generator.

<P>However, complex numbers will most likely have to go directly to Jasmin
for implementation on the JVM stack. Using the object-oriented methods
for complex arithmetic would likely produce unacceptable overhead for large
scale numerical problems. Jasmin can be used to translate complex numbers
and complex arithmetic operations directly into JVM stack arithmetic.

<P>The f2j project is composed of three phases:
<OL>
<LI>
Writing a Fortran front-end capable of lexing and parsing the subset of
Fortran necessary to translate BLAS and LAPACK.</LI>

<LI>
Generating Java source and Jasmin opcode to produce class files for use
with a JVM.</LI>

<LI>
Testing, documenting and distributing the translated BLAS and LAPACK class
files.</LI>
</OL>
Phases 1 and 2 are now complete for BLAS and LAPACK and we have just completed
Phase 3 testing. This testing has resulted in some changes to the initial
code design, requiring the Fortran front-end to be significantly extended.
The remaining work in Phase 3 will primarily involve specifying the user
interface.
<H4>
The BLAS, Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines</H4>
Java BLAS is translated from the BLAS Fortran reference source archived
at the <A HREF="http://www.netlib.org">Netlib</A> numerical software repository.
BLAS is composed of three levels of linear algebra operations:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Level</B> 1 BLAS consists of vector-vector operations such as dot product,
etc.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Level</B> 2 BLAS consists of vector-matrix operations.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Level</B> 3 BLAS consists of matrix-matrix operations.&nbsp;
</LI>
</UL>
BLAS levels 1, 2, and 3 have passed the Netlib test suite.
<H4>
LAPACK, Linear Algebra Package</H4>
Java LAPACK has now completed the testing stage. Some of the main design
issues are:
<UL>
<LI>
Arrays are being implemented as 1 dimensional in the Java translation.
Access is by index arithmetic, using leading dimensions declared in the
Fortran source. User interface issues have not yet been resolved.</LI>

<LI>
Certain variables are returned by reference, which has no counterpart in
Java. Currently all scalar variables will be wrapped as an object with
a single (value) field. This has obvious performance implications, but
it is a convenient first step towards getting a working Java implementation
of LAPACK. We will certainly be working on optimizations in the future.</LI>

<LI>
Translation of <TT>GOTO </TT>statements is done with a post-translation
processing step. First, we use f2java to translate the Fortran code to
Java. <TT>GOTOs </TT>are automatically translated as calls to a dummy class.
So, <TT>GO TO 100 </TT>would be translated as <TT>Dummy.go_to(100); </TT>.
The labels in the Fortran source are also translated as calls to the dummy
class (for example, the label 100 becomes <TT>Dummy.label(100); </TT>in
the Java source). Next we compile the Java file as usual (using <TT>javac</TT>).
We then use a special program to analyze the bytecode and translate the
dummy goto calls to real JVM goto instructions. Our tool is based on the
bytecode parser in <A HREF="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/~ajcbik/JAVAB/">javab</A>,
a bytecode parallelizing tool under development at the University of Indiana.</LI>
</UL>
A general solution for translating Fortran to Java may not be available
without using object methods, possibly incurring large performance penalties.
Our alternative is to chose those features most important to efficiency
in numerical analysis, and direct the translation using the known structure
of the BLAS and LAPACK Fortran source.

Fortran source to Java source</H4>
All of the double precision BLAS and LAPACK Fortran source code has been
translated directly to Java source. Some sample files to examine:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="code/dsymm.f">dsymm.f</A>, a matrix-matrix multiplication subroutine.</LI>

<LI>
The translated Java source produced by f2java <A HREF="code/Dsymm.java">Dsymm.java</A>
Dsymm.java was filtered through <A HREF="http://www.blaze.bc.ca/~jspeton/percolator/">Percolator</A>
using the default formatting options.</LI>

<LI>
Output class <A HREF="code/Xerbla.java">Xerbla.java</A> to display error
conditions.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
Fortran source to Jasmin opcode</H4>
Jasmin provides a straightfoward method to assemble Java Virtual Machine
byte code from a set of assembler instructions identical to instructions
emitted by Sun's disassembler. Since Fortran 77 does not specify <TT>while</TT>
loops, these are implemented in BLAS and LAPACK using <TT>goto</TT> statements,
which are supported at the JVM level.
<UL>
