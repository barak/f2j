To run the timers, simply execute the appropriate script, which
depends on the operating system you are running.

Some of the output is not exactly as the Fortran versions
would be (e.g. some arrays are printed as "NULL", but that is
only a limitation of the f2j I/O handling), however this
does not affect the running of the timers.
