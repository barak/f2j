JLAPACK 0.8 -- released May 31, 2007

  This is a beta release of JLAPACK based on LAPACK version 3.1.1.
 The previous translation was based on version 3.0, so there have been
 many changes to LAPACK since then.  See the following for details:

   http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-3.1.0.changes
   http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-3.1.1.changes

 As with the previous version, there are single and double precision
 versions of all routines (no complex yet) with different Java strictfp
 modes available.

 Translation of formatted output in the testers is also improved.

 The single and double precision jar files have been merged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JLAPACK 0.7 -- released January 31, 2007

  There are several improvements in this release.  First, there are
 now single precision versions of all the BLAS and LAPACK libraries
 as well as testers.  There are versions of the libraries
 that use Java's strict floating point mode and strict version of
 the Java math library.  Also for this release, there are translations
 of the LAPACK timing routines.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JLAPACK 0.6-strict -- released December 7, 2006

  This release contains versions of JLAPACK that use Java's strict
floating-point features.  Otherwise, it should be the same as 0.6.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JLAPACK 0.6 -- released January 14, 2002

  Changed the way that variables are declared.  f2j now generates variables
 as local to the method (where possible).  This normally gives better
 performance than using static class variables.

  Fixed a bug in the simplified interfaces.  Thanks to Michael DiClemente
 for the bug report.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JLAPACK 0.5 -- released August 23, 2001

  This version can be generated either as Java source or directly as
 JVM bytecode.  The main change for 0.5 is that the library is based
 on the LAPACK 3.0 source code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JLAPACK 0.4 -- unreleased

  This was the first version generated directly as JVM bytecode. This
 version was never released because it was based on the LAPACK 2.0 sources
 and we wanted the next release to be based on the LAPACK 3.0 sources.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JLAPACK 0.3a released June 5, 1998

  This is an update to version 0.3, only minor changes have been made.

  This release is reorganized a bit to make life easier on Win 95/NT
 users.  The JLAPACK classes are now all grouped into one ZIP file,
 much like the core Java classes.  So, users should adjust their 
 CLASSPATH to point at the ZIP file instead of jlapack-0.3/classes.
 The INSTALL file has details.

  Also the source code for the simplified interfaces is now stored in
 the "ssrc" directory, rather than in "src".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JLAPACK 0.3 released May 22, 1998

  This is the first general release of JLAPACK.

  The major change for this release is that we no longer wrap every
 scalar in a wrapper.  We wrap only those scalars that really need
 to be wrapped - that is, they are modified in the function/subroutine
 or in some called function/subroutine.  This helps a lot in the BLAS
 and LAPACK libraries since most scalars are not modified.  Of course,
 this means that the interface is totally different from the previous
 version.

  This release contains some simplified front-ends to the numerical
 routines.  They should provide a more "Java-like" interface to the
 underlying functions by accepting row-major 2D arrays and omitting
 unnecessary parameters such as leading dimension and offset.
  
  Comments from the original fortran source code are now retained
 in the Java source.

  This release was compiled with Sun's JDK 1.1.6 on Solaris 2.5 with
 optimization turned off (using -O didn't seem to help much).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JLAPACK 0.2 released Apr 15, 1998

  This release is organized into packages:
    org.netlib.blas    -  BLAS
    org.netlib.lapack  -  LAPACK
    org.netlib.util    -  utilities needed by f2java-translated programs

  This release was also compiled with optimization on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JLAPACK 0.1 released Apr 1, 1998

  This is basically an early evaluation version distributed to only 
  a few people.
