JLAPACK Examples
----------------

This directory contains some basic examples showing how to call JLAPACK
routines.  There is no error handling or anything fancy like that.
Sometimes I don't even initialize the arrays.  It's just to show how
to arrange the calling sequence.

BLAS examples:
  DdotTest.java

BLAS simplified interface examples:
  SimpleDdotTest.java

LAPACK examples:
  DlaruvTest.java
  DgesvdTest.java
  DsygvTest.java
  DsyevTest.java
  DstevrTest.java
  DgeevTest.java
  DgeqrfTestFullQ.java
  SsptrfTest.java

LAPACK simplified interface examples:
  SimpleDgesvdTest.java
  SimpleDsygvTest.java
  SimpleDgeqrfTestFullQ.java
  SimpleDgeqrfTest.java

To build the examples, just do "make" here (after building JLAPACK of course).
