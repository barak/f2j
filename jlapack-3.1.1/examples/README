JLAPACK Examples
----------------

This directory contains some basic examples showing how to call JLAPACK
routines.  There is no error handling or anything fancy like that.
Sometimes I don't even initialize the arrays.  It's just to show how
to arrange the calling sequence.

  DdotTest.java          - simple example of how to call a BLAS routine
  SimpleDdotTest.java    - example of calling a simplified interface from BLAS
  DlaruvTest.java        - simple example of how to call a LAPACK routine
  DgesvdTest.java        - another LAPACK example
  DsygvTest.java         - another LAPACK example
  DstevrTest.java        - another LAPACK example
  SimpleDgesvdTest.java  - example of calling a simplified interface from LAPACK
  SimpleDsygvTest.java   - example of calling a simplified interface from LAPACK

To build the examples, just do "make" here (after building JLAPACK of course).
